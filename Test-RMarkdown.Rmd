## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Here is a nice alt text!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', dev = c("png", "jpeg", "pdf"), fig.path = "_book/figures//"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```
\
*Figure \@ref(fig:pressure). This is actually the caption!*

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
